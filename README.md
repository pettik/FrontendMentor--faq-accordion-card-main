## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, I need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if I've got something I'd like to practice, I should feel free to give it a go.
